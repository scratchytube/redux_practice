# Redux Workshop

## Setup

Clone this repo and make a branch for your code. There are three subfolders with exercises:

- `01-redux-fundamentals`
- `02-redux-toolkit`
- `03-react-redux`

Each of these exercise folders has a separate project we'll be working on during
the workshop to get hands-on practice writing Redux code. The readme files in
each of these folders has separate instructions for getting set up, so make sure
to get those up and running!
